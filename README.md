# React Native E-Commerce App
This is a basic mobile app created using React Native, NativeWind for styling, and Redux for state management.

## Features
- Browse products
- Add items to cart
- Remove items from cart
- Dark mode support with NativeWind

## Adding Items to Cart
* Users can add items to the cart directly from the  `Product Screen`.
* Only one category of items can be added to the cart at a time.
* If a user selects multiple sizes from the same category, they will be grouped as a single item in the cart, rather than appearing as separate products.
* Deleting an item from the cart will remove all associated data for that category, including the selected sizes.
